## How is this effort different from existing OpenAPI projects? ü§î

Existing OpenAPI projects are great for generating client libraries for REST APIs. However, they are sub-optimal for generating client libraries for OData services, because of the additional layer of semantics OData offers.

In case you favor OpenAPI, have a look at below projects instead:

- [Kiota](https://microsoft.github.io/kiota/)
- [AutoREST](https://github.com/Azure/autorest)
- [OData to OpenAPI Generator](https://aka.ms/ODataOpenAPI)
